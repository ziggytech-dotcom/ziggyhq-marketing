      },
      {
        q: 'Do I need a credit card to sign up?',
        a: 'No. You can start your 14-day free trial with just an email address. We only ask for payment information when you decide to subscribe.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How long does setup take?',
        a: 'Most teams are fully set up in under an hour. Connect your email, import your contacts, and create your first pipeline. We provide onboarding guides and video walkthroughs to help you hit the ground running.',
      },

        q: 'Can I import my existing contacts?',

      },
      {
        q: 'How does seat/team pricing work?',
        a: 'Each plan includes base seats. Add more at the per-seat rate: $12/seat/mo on Starter, $10/seat/mo on Pro. Seats are billed monthly alongside your base plan. You can add or remove seats anytime.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Can I change plans anytime?',

      },
      {
        q: 'Is there an annual discount?',
        a: 'Yes — pay annually and save 10%. Starter drops to $26/mo (vs $29) and Pro to $44/mo (vs $49). Annual billing is billed once upfront.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Do you offer refunds?',
        a: 'We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on your first payment if you\'re not satisfied. After that, subscriptions are non-refundable, but you can cancel before your next billing cycle to avoid future charges.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What happens after my trial ends?',
        a: 'If you add a payment method and choose a plan, your account continues uninterrupted. If you don\'t, your account is paused. Your data is retained for 30 days, after which it\'s permanently deleted.',

      {
        q: 'How does the power dialer work?',
